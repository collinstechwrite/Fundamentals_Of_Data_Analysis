    "4. November 30th, 2020: Simpson’s paradox is a well-known statistical paradox where a trend evident in a number of groups reverses when the groups are combined into one big data set. Use numpy to create four data sets, each with an x array and a corresponding y array, to demonstrate Simpson’s paradox. You might create your x arrays using numpy.linspace and create the y array for each x using notation like y = a * x + b where you choose the a and b for each x , y pair to demonstrate the paradox. You might see the Wikipedia page for Simpson’s paradox for inspiration.\n",
