# Fundamentals_Of_Data_Analysis

This is the README.MD file for Fundamentals Of Data Analysis Tasks

Tasks can be summarized as follows
1. Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as
input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of
times each item appears as values. So, the input ['A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A']
should have output {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'C': 1} .

2. Write a Python function called dicerolls that simulates
rolling dice. Your function should take two parameters: the number of dice k and
the number of times to roll the dice n. The function should simulate randomly
rolling k dice n times, keeping track of each total face value. It should then return
a dictionary with the number of times each possible total face value occurred. So,
calling the function as diceroll(k=2, n=1000) should return a dictionary like:
{2:19,3:50,4:82,5:112,6:135,7:174,8:133,9:114,10:75,11:70,12:36}

3. Write some python code that simulates flipping a coin 100 times. 
Then run this code 1,000 times, keeping track of the number of heads in each of the 
1,000 simulations. Select an appropriate plot to depict the resulting list of 1,000 numbers, 
showing that it roughly follows a bell-shaped curve. You should explain your work in a Markdown 
cell above the code.

4. Simpson’s paradox is a well-known statistical paradox
where a trend evident in a number of groups reverses when the groups are combined
into one big data set. Use numpy to create four data sets, each with an x array
and a corresponding y array, to demonstrate Simpson’s paradox. 

My final work on these tasks can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file All_Tasks.ipynb
I have run the kernel so the results of code for all tasks should be showing, however
you can download and run the code for each task in the Jupyter Notebook.
